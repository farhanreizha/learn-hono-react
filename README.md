# React + TypeScript + Vite + Hono

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR, some ESLint rules, and Hono integration for server-side rendering and API routes.

## Features

- React for building user interfaces
- TypeScript for type safety
- Vite for fast development and building
- Hono for API routes
- ESLint for code linting
<!-- - Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for quick updates during development -->

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
4. Open your browser and navigate to ui `http://localhost:5173`
5. Open your browser and navigate to api `http://localhost:3000/api/`

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Contains your React components and client-side code
- `src/api` - Contains your Hono API routes
- `public/` - Static assets that will be served directly

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Starts the development server
- `npm run build` - Builds the app for production
- `npm run lint` - Runs ESLint to check your code
<!-- - `npm run serve` - Serves the built app -->

Happy coding!
